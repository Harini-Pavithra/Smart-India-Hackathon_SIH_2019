- Heartbeat and pulse monitoring sensor is used to discern BPM(Beats Per Minute) of the user.
- Pressure sensor is used to discern live weight tracking,detecting how much is being lifted and sharing it with a Bluetooth-connected smartphone application. 
- Pyroelectric sensor is used to discern the direction of motion and detect the number of reps performed by the user during workouts. 
- GPS is used to discern the step counts of the user based on their daily activities. 
- When any abnormal heart beats are detected using Heartbeat and pulse monitoring sensor, an audio with various breathing exercises are played for the user to get an
